# 🖼️ Image Slider

A clean, responsive image slider built using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. Features include manual slide navigation, autoplay with hover pause, and pagination indicators.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 Autoplay with interval
- ⏸️ Pauses on hover
- ⬅️➡️ Left and right arrow navigation
- ⭕ Pagination dots to indicate active slide
- 📱 Fully responsive (thanks to TailwindCSS)

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. `imageUrls[]` contains the sources of all images.
2. The current image is tracked via `currentIdx`.
3. Autoplay runs every 3 seconds using `setInterval`.
4. Hovering over the image container pauses autoplay.
5. Clicking the arrows updates the slide manually.
